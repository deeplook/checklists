Checklists
==========

So you know everything about getting things doneâ„¢? Great! Then move
on to getting things *right*! This is an effort in creating something
like checklists in the context of software, from development to
deployment and beyond.

The one main
inspiration for this comes from the book `"The Checklist Manifesto"
<http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/>`_
by Atul Gawande, a Harward surgeon who also presented the topic in his
respective `TED <http://www.ted.com/>`_ talk
`"How do we heal medicine?" 
<http://www.ted.com/talks/atul_gawande_how_do_we_heal_medicine>`_.
In both he argues that increasingly growing knowledge and complex
procedures have become primary challenges for experts in his field
and lead to sophisticated medical care systems often performing
surprisingly badly. He then shows how a simple solution like checklists
adopted from other domains can help dramatically reduce many of these
systems' faults.

At the moment you can find here only a few notes which might turn
into some documentation project based on Sphinx, or some kind of forms
on some website or a mobile app. 

More to come...
